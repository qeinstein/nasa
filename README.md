# ðŸŒŒ Exoplanet Dashboard ðŸš€

The **Exoplanet Dashboard** is a web application designed to explore, predict, and visualize exoplanet data from NASAâ€™s KOI and TESS catalogs. It leverages a **hybrid ensemble model** combining classical machine learning and quantum-inspired models, delivering high-quality predictions, interpretability, and interactive visualizations.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- **Hybrid Ensemble Predictions:** Combines Random Forest (classical) and Quantum Hybrid (QML) models for robust exoplanet classification.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Histograms, pairplots, t-SNE, UMAP embeddings, and feature importance plots.
- **Explainability:** SHAP for classical models, permutation importance for QML models, and combined importance plots.
- **Base64 Image Rendering:** All plots are sent to the frontend as Base64 images for seamless rendering.
- **File Upload Support:** Users can upload CSV files to get instant predictions and visualizations.
- **Responsive Dashboard:** Built with React, TailwindCSS, and Framer Motion for smooth animations and responsiveness.
